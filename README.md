Talking about cloud, I started working with data using **Google Cloud Platform**. Considering this, I have experience with some tools such as Google BigQuery and Compute Engine. At the moment, I am using and learning more and more about **Amazon Web Services**, and I already can perform with some tools: **AWS Lambda**, **Step Functions**, **DataBrew** and others. 

I also work with **Python** and love scripting, consuming APIs and building simple & cool integrations/ETLs, such as [ZDTL Integration](https://github.com/wgkdata/zdtl-integration).
